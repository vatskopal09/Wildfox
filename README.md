# WildFox-Global-Sales-Analysis-and-Dashboard-using-Power-BI


Problem Statement
WildFox, a global retail company, is facing challenges in analyzing and managing their sales data effectively. They struggle to derive meaningful insights from their state-wise and country-level sales data, which limits their ability to identify key revenue drivers and areas for improvement. A comprehensive analysis and visualization of this data are necessary to guide strategic business decisions.

Country: Country of the store
Region: Geographic classification (e.g., North America, Europe)
Sales: Total sales revenue
Quantity: Number of units sold
Discount: Discounts offered
Profit: Net profit
Store ID: Unique identifier for each store
Category: Product category (if applicable)
